# Semantic Search for PSD2

A Streamlit app created in Python that allows the user to input queries about PSD2 and retrieve related text from a PDF file.




## General Info

This project has been created to learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP) during Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The Payment Service Directive (PSD2) is a European Union regulation that aims to enhance the security of electronic payments, promote competition in the financial sector, and provide better consumer protection. It was implemented in 2018 and has had a relevant impact in the payments sector.

The embeddings have been created using the SBERT model 'msmarco-distilbert-base-dot-prod-v3'.
